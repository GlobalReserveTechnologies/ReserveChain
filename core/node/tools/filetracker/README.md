File Tracker
-----------

This module is responsible for tracking files in the repository, hashing them,
and writing metadata into the database for reproducible builds and audits.

DevNet: a simple scanner can be run manually or wired into scripts.
MainNet: a hardened tracker would be part of the build pipeline / CI.
